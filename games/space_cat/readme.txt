Our project deserves the full 100 points because:
1) We put a lot of effort into the gravity and kinematics to make it seem realistic and fun to play.

2) We explored some advanced tools with canvas elements
  such as transformations and rotations to make drawing 
  in the game quicker. 

3) We employed random generation and radial gradients 
  to create beautiful star clusters of different colors.

4) We implemented music and full audio.

5) We added animations for the lander exhaust.

6) We created a system of leveling. This includes: 
    - Lander pad gets smaller with every level 
    - Added fuel for every level passed up to level 9
    - Score incrementation based on a function of lander speed and level

7) We did research on how to make the game run at a buttery smooth 60 frames per second.

8) We used trigonometry to implement realistic contact points on landing.

9) We hid a cheatcode key in the keyboard (just a single key no combinations). We'll give you the key for bonus points :).

10) We made a custom lander and thumbnail.
